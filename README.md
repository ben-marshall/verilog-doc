This project aims to provide a Doxygen-like tool for the Verilog Hardware
Description Language (HDL).

It is currently under heavy development, and in the early stages of
construction. None the less, it can parse input source trees using the general
purpose [verilog-parser](https://github.com/ben-marshall/verilog-parser)
library and spit out a module hierarchy and file list, as well as document a
modules ports.
